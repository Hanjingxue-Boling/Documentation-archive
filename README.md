# What's this?

It is used to store documents and press releases that I have written.

All documents are in markdown document format and are distributed under the CC-BY-SA license by default.

# Why not make it a blog?

Because I'm stupid and lazy, it's as simple as that.</p>
~~I tried several times to build a static blog, but it didn't work...~~

# What are the main contents?

The main content includes the press release I posted at suse.org.cn and the personally translated posts I posted in the [openSUSE Chinese forum](https://forum.suse.org.cn/).
